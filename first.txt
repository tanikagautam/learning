Ten pundits (holy men) went to the Ganga to take a dip in the river.
They held each other’s hands as they took dips thrice. When they came up the third
time, they were not holding hands.
“Let’s make sure all of us have come out of the river safely,” said a pundit,
“Everybody stand in line. I will count.”
